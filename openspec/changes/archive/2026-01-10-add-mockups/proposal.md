# Mockups First Workflow

## Why
Visual alignment is critical for the "Map-First" dashboard concept. To avoid wasted backend effort, we need to agree on the visual layout of the HUD overlays and Cesium integration before writing functional code.

## What Changes
*   Add a requirement to generate static HTML/Svelte mockups of the dashboard.
*   These mockups must be reviewed and approved by the stakeholder (User) before any backend service implementation begins.

## Impact
*   **Reduced Rework**: Ensures the UI matches executive expectations early.
*   **Clearer Specs**: Visuals often reveal missing data requirements for the backend.
